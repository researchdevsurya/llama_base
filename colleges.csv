This amount covers the tuition fees for all three years of study in the program. Admission eligibility requires candidates to have completed their 10+2 (Higher Secondary) education from a recognized board, preferably with a background in commerce, and selection is merit-based. The fee is payable as per the college's annual schedule and may be subject to change according to institutional policies.","Sterling College of Arts, Commerce and Science","Sterling College of Arts, Commerce and Science, located in Nerul (East), Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, was established in 2001 under the aegis of the National Centre for Rural Development (NCRD), a non-profit organization founded in 1991 in Pune. The college was created with the mission to provide higher education opportunities to youth, particularly those from rural and underdeveloped regions, reflecting NCRD’s broader commitment to rural upliftment and educational access. The institution is affiliated with the University of Mumbai and has received a Grade 'C' accreditation from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). Unlike some peer institutions, Sterling College is not recognized as an Institute of National Importance, nor does it hold UGC approval or AIU membership.

The physical infrastructure of Sterling College is situated at Plot No. 93/93A, Sector 19, Nerul (East), Thane, Maharashtra. The campus is shared with other NCRD institutions, including the Sterling Institute of Pharmacy and the Sterling Institute of Management Studies, fostering an academic environment with interdisciplinary exposure. The college offers dedicated facilities for its academic streams, including lecture halls equipped with modern teaching aids, computer laboratories with up-to-date hardware and software, a library with a substantial collection of academic resources, and seminar rooms for interactive sessions. While specific square footage and technical specifications are not publicly detailed, the campus is designed to support both undergraduate and postgraduate education in commerce, management, and related fields.

Academically, Sterling College offers full-time undergraduate and postgraduate programs, notably B.Com, M.Com, and BBM/BMS, structured to align with the University of Mumbai’s curriculum. The pedagogy emphasizes a blend of theoretical instruction and practical application, utilizing case studies, project-based learning, and regular assessments to ensure comprehensive understanding. The academic calendar is organized into semesters, with continuous internal evaluation and end-semester examinations. Faculty members, such as Dr. S. S. Patil (Principal) and Prof. A. S. Pawar (Head of Commerce), play pivotal roles in curriculum delivery and student mentorship, ensuring that the teaching methods remain current and industry-relevant.

Sterling College’s research ecosystem, while still developing compared to larger universities, encourages faculty and student participation in academic projects and seminars. The institution has hosted research workshops and conferences in collaboration with the University of Mumbai, focusing on topics such as rural development, financial inclusion, and entrepreneurship. Funding for these initiatives is primarily sourced from internal NCRD allocations and occasional grants from local industry partners. As of the latest available information, the college has not registered any patents, but it continues to promote research culture through faculty development programs and student research competitions.

The industry interface at Sterling College is characterized by active engagement with corporate partners in the Mumbai and Navi Mumbai regions. The college has established collaborations with companies such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Life, and Tata Consultancy Services for student internships, guest lectures, and placement drives. For example, the annual campus recruitment program regularly features participation from these organizations, providing students with practical exposure and employment opportunities. Unlike some metropolitan colleges with extensive international linkages, Sterling College’s industry partnerships are primarily regional but are tailored to the needs of its student body, ensuring relevant skill development and job readiness upon graduation.",maharashtra_mumbai,2001
