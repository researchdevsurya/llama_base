## How to convert this to a ranked list / CSV

* **Recommended columns:** `Name | Area | City/MMR | Type (University/Autonomous/Affiliated) | Streams (Soc/Psy/Pol/Econ/Anth/Policy/SW) | Levels (UG/PG/PhD) | Source link`.
* **Ranking signals:** Autonomy/NAAC grade, national visibility (NIRF/recognitions), research output, PG/PhD depth (TISS/SNDT/Xavier’s), and student demand (applications/cutoffs).
* **Primary verification anchors:** MU affiliated-college master lists & PDFs; TISS School pages (UG/PG/PhD); SNDT university site; and top-arts directories. ([University of Mumbai][1])

If you want, I can **export this as a CSV** immediately (with empty “Streams/Levels” columns ready for your team to tick).
